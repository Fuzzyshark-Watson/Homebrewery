# Homebrewery

Also known as my Pathfinder Homebrewery, is essentially a hobby/self-teaching process wherein I try to learn the C# system by developing a program.

The purpose of my program is to develop a character creation program for the Pathfinder 1st edition game, and my personal rules are as follows:

1. Make it work.
2. Make it good.
3. Make it fast.
4. Make no changes unless necessary, balancing is not my job.

Long term, I would like to make it a somewhat viable platform to simulate character stats as well as apply conditional modifiers like special attacks, or in the form of spell enhancements to character, gear or other things.

I think it would be fun to put it into a unity engine and create the resources and means to simulate combat such that you can see if any given build you've created for yourself feels interesting to play, but I have no ownership of the game so I have no intentions to do any of this as a means to get money from it. My hopes are thus far stiffled by my incompetence, but I'm settled in for a 5 year education so I will have plenty of time to practice.

Pathfinder is a system with a relatively high fluidity, as I have frustrated my teacher endlessly. I find myself replying "Yes but no." whenever he tries to find out what my parametres are, every part of races, classes and indeed ability scores, needs to be interchangeable when you want to opt into variants of the same, while strictly adhering to the defined rules.

Races have subtypes and alternative racial modifiers that change or replace elements of the parent race.
Classes have archetypes that change or entirely replace elements of the parent class.

I plan to start by making a functional "Core" fighter class, and human race.

**Alas, my current to-do list is:**
1. ~~Create Ability scores and Point-buy.~~ 
2. ~~Define character abilities: HP, AC, spell resistances, melee attack, etc.~~
3. ~~Create a skills list.~~
4. Create and understand the use of, databases for future development of the items below.
5. Create the complicated stuff which needs to be manipulated.
    - Races with their inbuilt sizes, speeds, and native core traits, in a way where I can make the program "exchange" them later.
    - Classes with their inbuilt qualities and core abilities in a way where I can make the program "exchange" them later.
6. Create character defining abilities which add stats, moves and qualities which are static but have prerequisites.
    - Feats which add special qualities
    - Traits which add special qualities, "Class skills" and similar starting elements.(Half-feats)
7. Create items, weapons, armor, which changes your character statistics.
8. Add tempoary effects, such as feat special attacks, class abilities or the basics for spell enhancements.
9. Create spells, spells lists and the classes which makes use of them.
10. Add multiple character management at once, including familiars and animal companions.

And then I can add any of my ideas past this point, to expand into my own interest.
- Add rolling dice capabilities.
- Add suggestions, tips, tooltips, saving "build" orders.
- Multiple client interaction; Player A sends healing to player B, C and D.
